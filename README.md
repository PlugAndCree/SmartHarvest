# SmartHarvest
*This simple plugins allows your users to break & replant the crops with a simple right-click*

This plugin use the `BlockBreakEvent` to check if the player can interact with the crop in order to harvest them, so it's compatible with **EVERY** plugin.

This plugin naturally break the crops with the item in player's main hand, so a hoe with Fortune III drops more carrots
